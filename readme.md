As a human who wants to buy a house and is interested in data, I want to analyse sales data for the suburbs I'm interested in so that I can make better offers.

The data from the bulk NSW Valuer General's Property Sales Information (PSI) makes it really hard to download and analyse. And a subscription to Core Logic is really expensive. So here we are.

Basically:

* Python to download the latest copy of the (.zip) data files as they are regularly updated

* Python to extract the data from the data (.zip) files and delete all the junk

* Jupyter to do whatever analysis you want.

The code is a hot mess, but gets the job done.
